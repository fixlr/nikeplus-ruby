== NikePlus-ruby
Ruby implementation of the unofficial NikePlus web API.  

I've been frustrated with the nikeplus.com flash site lately and decided to 
take a stab at writing a ruby interface for the web API described in the
NikePlus PHP implementation by Rasmus Lerdorf and the Perl implementation
of WWW::Nike::NikePlus.

(Oh well. Kind of bored with this now. I have an RSS for my recent runs
 generated from a cron job, and that's really all I wanted.)
